![Artificial Neural Network](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*ZdN275sTHpsefthC)



A general neural network model with variable configuration to experiment on for image recognition, speech recognition, sentiment analysis  e.t.c

Easily experiment on different architectures {input(features) nodes, no of hidden layers and output nodes} and training parameters i.e lambda, no of iterations (epoch number) e.t.c

The motivation behind Neuro Lab is to have one neural network being used for any classification problem.


Supported Python versions
-----------------------

Neuro Lab supports Python 3+.
